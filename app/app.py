Here is a basic Python Flask API code that implements the loan pre-qualification algorithm based on the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint to collect applicant financial data
@app.route('/collect_data', methods=['POST'])
def collect_data():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Validate and process the data
    # ...

    return jsonify({'message': 'Data collected successfully'})

# Endpoint to integrate with credit bureaus
@app.route('/retrieve_credit_report', methods=['POST'])
def retrieve_credit_report():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Call credit bureau API to retrieve credit report
    # ...

    return jsonify({'message': 'Credit report retrieved successfully'})

# Endpoint to assess creditworthiness and recommend loan terms
@app.route('/pre_qualification', methods=['POST'])
def pre_qualification():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Perform creditworthiness assessment and risk analysis
    # ...

    loan_amount = 10000 # Placeholder value
    interest_rate_range = (5.0, 10.0) # Placeholder value

    return jsonify({
        'loan_amount': loan_amount,
        'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range
    })

# Other endpoints for error handling, asynchronous processing, etc.
# ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Please note that this code provides a basic structure for the Flask API and includes the endpoints mentioned in the user story. You will need to implement the logic for data validation, credit bureau integration, creditworthiness assessment, and other requirements according to your specific needs.
